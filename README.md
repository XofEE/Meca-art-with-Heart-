The "Meca-art (With Heart)" project is a creative endeavor that allows anyone to build a mechanical heart from the 'OP' logo using 3D printing.
This project is accessible to makers of all levels, emphasizing that the creation process is open to everyone. It's shared under the GPL 3.0 license, ensuring freedom to use, modify, and distribute.
For building, you'll need access to 3D printing facilities to print the provided STL files, alongside basic electronics (a dc motor, 2 metal rods) and assembly materials.
This initiative not only showcases mechanical artistry but also invites the community to engage with technology and creativity.
